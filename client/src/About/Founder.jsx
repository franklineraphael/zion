            <strong>Mrs. Angela Ekebafe</strong> is an educationist of
            excellence who is passionate about the spiritual, emotional, and
            educational development of children. She identifies that the needs
            of children go beyond what is readily available in the typical
            educational setting. Thus, armed with a quest to help children fully
            harness their God-given potentials, Zionlight Services was born.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mrs. Ekebafe earned a Bachelor of Science in Education (B.Sc. Ed)
            from the prestigious University of Port Harcourt, and a Master of
            Science degree from the University of Ibadan.
          </p>
          <p>
            To further prepare for the vision she carries, she obtained several
            certifications including: Modern Montessori International (MMI)
            London, Hope for Kids/Lead Today Training, Mailbox Club
            International (for Childrenâ€™s Ministers), FATE Entrepreneur Program
            (EPP), Word of Faith Bible Institute, and Daystar Leadership Academy
            among others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her deep love for children and unwavering dedication to helping them
            know God and prosper in all areas of life is what makes Zionlight
            Services a beacon of transformative education and support.
