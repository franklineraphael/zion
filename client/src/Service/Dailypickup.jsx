        Our daily pick up service embraces children from the ages of 1 and
        above. This service affords parents the opportunity of having their
        children in a safe and conducive environment, while they attend to their
        daily responsibilities and urgent pressing needs. We also accept
        occasional daily pick-up, this option is mostly used during public
        holidays, weekends, mid â€“term holidays and vacations. The children will
        be adequately catered for, exposed to activities commensurate to their
        age, and given all round support.
