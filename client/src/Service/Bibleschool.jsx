        Zionlight Bible School is a core arm of the organization. This is where
        the children get more enlightened about God’s word from a very tender
        age, to train them up to <br />
        be vessels for the Lord (Prov.22:6). The world is filled with so many
        vices and policies that do not glorify God. Our mission in this area is
        to get more children to Christ <br /> and build their faith in God.
        Zionlight wants to groom children who will serve the Lord with all their
        heart and experience that special encounter of God’s Love. (John 3:16)
      </p>
      <p>
        For this reason, the institution created the Zionlight Bible School to
        set them apart for the work of God and be a light to their world. Every
        Saturday, children from all <br />
        walks of life throng our premises, and are fed with the word of God. Our
        bible school features intense prayers, heartfelt worship, hands on bible
        expositions, practical <br />
        application of lessons taught, call to salvation, and attractive
        activities. There are no fees required to be a part of the Bible School,
        materials are given freely, and the <br />
        participants are fed. Our sessions are always streamed, you can watch
        your children or join our classes online.
