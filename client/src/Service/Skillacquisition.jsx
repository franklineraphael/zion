            The Zionlight Skill Acquisition Program(ZISAP) was an aspiring idea
            in the mind. In order to develop the social, emotional, physical and
            spiritual factors in a child, the organization decided to set up a
            program in which would help the children discover their talents and
            abilities, for them to be a solution to the world and become people
            of greatness in years to come.
          </p>
          <p className=" md:text-2xl mt-10">
            This program was introduced in summer 2018 with an aspiring goal to
            “Build the future in children; raising a generation”. The 2018
            edition started off with a number of 35 children and in subsequent
            editions the numbers have thrived beyond 100 children. Currently,
            the children in this program have developed those skills and have
            become professionals at what they do. Some of them are now
            professional photographers, graphic designers and make-up artists.
            You are also invited to this program.

            The program is not free and it comes at price. The following below
            are the skills that are made available to the children:
